## Demo

This template demonstrates how to build an AI-powered chat interface using Cloudflare Workers AI with streaming responses. It features:

- Real-time streaming of AI responses using Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Easy customization of models and system prompts
- Support for AI Gateway integration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Cloudflare account
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) installed

### Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

That's it! Your chat application will be live on your workers.dev subdomain.

## Architecture

This template consists of three main components:

### Backend

The backend is a Cloudflare Worker (in `src/index.ts`) that:

1. **Handles Chat Requests**: Receives chat messages via POST to `/api/chat`
2. **Streams AI Responses**: Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) to stream responses from Workers AI in real-time
3. **Workers AI Binding**: Connects to Cloudflare's AI service via the Workers AI binding

### Frontend

The frontend is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript application that:

1. Presents a chat interface
2. Sends user messages to the API
3. Processes streaming responses in real-time
4. Maintains chat history on the client side

## Customization

### Changing the Model

To use a different AI model, update the `MODEL_ID` constant in `src/index.ts`. You can find available models in the [Cloudflare Workers AI documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/).

### Using AI Gateway

The template includes commented code for AI Gateway integration, which provides additional capabilities like rate limiting, caching, and analytics.

To enable AI Gateway:

1. [Create an AI Gateway](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ai/ai-gateway) in your Cloudflare dashboard
2. Uncomment the gateway configuration in `src/index.ts`
3. Replace `YOUR_GATEWAY_ID` with your actual AI Gateway ID
4. Configure other gateway options as needed:
   - `skipCache`: Set to `true` to bypass gateway caching
   - `cacheTtl`: Set the cache time-to-live in seconds

### Modifying the System Prompt

The default system prompt can be changed by updating the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` constant in `src/index.ts`.

### Styling

The UI styling is contained in the `<style>` section of `public/index.html`. You can modify the CSS variables at the top to quickly change the color scheme.
